# BCG_GenAI_Job_Simulation
In this Project, As a junior data scientist at BCG's GenAI Consulting team, I'm developing an AI-powered chatbot for a leading global financial institution, Global Finance Corp. (GFC), that can analyze and provide insights on corporate financial performance from 10-K and 10-Q financial documents, aiming to extract key data, identify trends, and offer user-friendly insights. My goal is to leverage these insights for strategic client recommendations.
